rails
has migrations

migrations = updates the DB schema
rails g migration <describe ur migration>

rake db:migrate = to run migration
rake db:rollback = to rollback a migration

check your schema.rb = if migration is correct. dapat mag reflect sa schema.rb

table should ALWAYS be plural and snake_case
always add timestamps <--kasi auto naman siya and additional logging

RAILS has models

MODELS are used to associate tables to ruby classes
ACTIVERECORD = ORM ni ruby = ORM Object Relational Mapping

MODEL file name should be SINGULAR, NO CAPS, SNAKE_CASE
ALWAYS EXTEND TO ApplicationRecord eg. class User < ApplicationRecord 
WHY? to discuss LATER.

RAILS HAS many ways to build your associations.
BUT only use 3
belongs_to, has_many, has_one

belongs_to, has_one ALWAYS receive singular parameter
ex. 
belongs_to :user
has_one :status

has_many recieves PLURAL parameter
ex.
has_many :tasks
